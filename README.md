# MonsterDome
overly simple python game

Purpose: 
Provide the developer an interesting way to gain skills in programming increasingly complex software/code

Objective: 
Develop and arena combat rpg-like game. Characters or "Monasters" will be selected to battle. The monsters will have the ability to 'improve' their attributes to increase survivability in future fights. Monsters can be created and stored in the "Pen" where they can be later selected for combat in the arena 

Status:
Currently introducing a gui for the game, using Tk through pythons Tkinter module. Proper moduler design and scoping is being investigated to keep the project clean.
