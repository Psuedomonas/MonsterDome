# MonsterDome

Overly simple python game

Purpose: 
Provide the developer an interesting way to gain skills in programming increasingly complex software/code

Objective: 
Develop an arena combat rpg-like game. Characters or "Monsters" will be selected to battle. The monsters will have the ability to 'improve' their attributes to increase survivability in future fights. Monsters can be created and stored in the "Pen" where they can be later selected for combat in the arena 

Status:
Currently introducing a gui for the game, using Tk through pythons Tkinter module. Review of function, object and module scope rules is underway to enable further development. Further understanding of Tkinter will also be pursued. User text imput will be required and combat method will be re-developed.
